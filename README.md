# Flutly Store

Flutly is a **demo e-commerce mobile application** built with Flutter to showcase clean architecture, feature-based organization, and production-ready patterns.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Flutter & Dart**
- **State management:** `flutter_bloc`
- **Navigation:** `go_router`
- **Dependency injection:** `get_it`
- **Networking:** `dio`
- **Local storage:** `shared_preferences`, `flutter_secure_storage`
- **Forms:** `reactive_forms`
- **Localization:** `easy_localization`

### Firebase

- Authentication
- Firestore
- Analytics
- Crashlytics

### Sanity

- Used as CRM/content source for the Home experience

## 🏗 Architecture

Flutly follows a **feature-first Clean Architecture** approach.

Each feature (e.g. `auth`, `catalog`, `checkout`) is divided into:

- **presentation**  
  UI, pages, widgets, BLoC/Cubit
- **domain**  
  Entities, use cases, repository contracts
- **data**  
  Data sources and repository implementations

### Shared infrastructure

- `lib/app/core`  
  Routing, dependency injection, HTTP client, storage
- `lib/app/shared`  
  Theme, shared widgets, utilities

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (`sdk: ^3.9.2`)
- Android Studio or Xcode
- CocoaPods (for iOS)

### Configuration

#### Environment variables

Environment values are provided via `--dart-define`.

Example using a JSON file:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.prod.json
```

Or manually:

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://dummyjson.com/products \
  --dart-define=CRM_BASE_URL=https://veushuon.api.sanity.io/v2025-12-27/data/query/production
```

#### Firebase

Firebase configuration is defined in `lib/firebase_options.dart`.

To regenerate:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

### Running the App

Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

For iOS:

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

Run on device or emulator:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.prod.json
```

## 🧪 Running the Tests

### Unit and Widget Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

These tests ensure that individual units of the code work as expected.

### Test Coverage

To evaluate the test coverage:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

Then, generate a coverage report:

```bash
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

Open `index.html` in the coverage directory to view the report.
