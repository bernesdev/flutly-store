## 💡 Technical Decisions

### Why BLoC?

I chose flutter_bloc for its strict separation of presentation and business logic. It provides a predictable state stream, making it easier to trace bugs and write unit tests for every user interaction.

### The "Demo Mode"

To make this portfolio project easy to run for recruiters and developers, I implemented a Demo Mode.

- Challenge: The app needed to function fully without requiring valid Firebase credentials.
- Solution: Based on environment variables, the Dependency Injection (GetIt) swaps the real Firebase implementations for Mock implementations at runtime. This ensures the UI code remains completely agnostic of the data source.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (`sdk: ^3.9.2`)
- Android Studio or Xcode
- CocoaPods (for iOS)

### Configuration

#### Environment variables

Environment values are provided via `--dart-define`. The project includes an env.example.json file preconfigured to run without backend friction.

#### ⚡ Demo Mode (Recommended)

By default, Flutly runs in demo mode. No Firebase project or credentials are needed. Authentication is simulated, and data is handled locally.

1. Create the env file:

```bash
cp env.example.json env.prod.json
```

2. Run the app:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.prod.json
```

#### 🔥 Firebase Mode

To enable real backend integration:

1. Open `env.prod.json` and set:

```bash
"USE_FIREBASE": true
```

2. Create a Firebase project (Auth + Firestore enabled).

3. Add configuration files (google-services.json / GoogleService-Info.plist).

4. Reconfigure via FlutterFire:

```bash
flutterfire configure
```

5. Run the app:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.prod.json
```

#### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# iOS setup
cd ios && pod install
```

## 🧪 Running the Tests

The project prioritizes test coverage for Domain logic, Use Cases, and Repositories.

### Unit and Widget Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Test Coverage

To generate coverage data and HTML report:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

> Note: `genhtml` is part of `lcov`.
> - macOS: `brew install lcov`
> - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install lcov`

## 🎨 Assets & Localization

- Assets: `assets/icons`, `assets/images`
- Localization: Handled via `easy_localization` (Current locale: `en`).
